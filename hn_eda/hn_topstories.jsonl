Joon is a mobile game that motivates kids to do tasks that they might not otherwise want to do\u2014things like chores, homework, brushing their teeth, or making their bed\u2014or things which they like, but not always in the moment\u2014calling a grandparent, for example. The game does this by embedding these tasks into fun \u201cQuests\u201d that the kids do want to do. Along the way, they develop good habits\u2014not because they\u2019re supposed to, but as a side effect of playing the game. Here\u2019s a short video to give you the idea: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OkOwk_wOBBE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OkOwk_wOBBE<\/a>.<p>One of the hardest parts of parenting (and of growing up!) is getting kids to do things that they don\u2019t enjoy. Parents usually see these as important activities that will help their kids become independent, responsible, and ultimately, happy. Kids, however, often don\u2019t feel the same way! This is an incentive alignment problem: kids want to have fun, parents want to raise a successful human. As technology advances, this is getting tougher, because kids want ever more tech while parents struggle to motivate and connect with them. Joon is our attempt at a \u2018middle path\u2019 that combines the fun tech that kids want to play with, and the good habit-building that parents want to see.<p>We started working on this idea when, shortly after college, the three of us had a conversation about our childhoods, and realized we had each played 10,000s of hours of video games when we were kids (mainly Runescape and Pokemon). While we didn\u2019t regret the fun we had, we wondered what would have happened if we had spent that time doing something more meaningful. Looking back, we felt that there could have been something fun like those games, but that would also have helped us grow in life skills. We\u2019re building Joon to be what we wish we\u2019d had as kids, and because it\u2019s something that parents are telling us they need right now.<p>Joon is a mobile game that\u2019s like a combination of Pokemon, Club Penguin, and Tamagotchi. The twist is that in order to take care of your pet and make progress in the game, you have to do parent-assigned or self-assigned \u201cQuests\u201d in real life. It\u2019s a world for kids where real-world activities and outcomes (mental health, relationship-building, cognitive development, physical health, etc) determine your outcomes in the game. Most importantly, it aligns the incentives of parents and kids by helping kids become more responsible through playing a game that they love.<p>Such a game must have very high retention (something which is difficult for mobile games) in order to keep the parent and child aligned. For this, it\u2019s critical that the game itself be the motivating factor, not external rewards. We\u2019ve been hearing about kids who are asking their parents for more tasks at home (whether it\u2019s chores or family activities) every day so they can play Joon, so it feels like we are on the right track.<p>This is how the app works currently: A parent initiates account creation and adds their kids, and then can choose from a suggested list of tasks to assign their kid. The child will choose a pet and see what tasks (that we call \u201cQuests\u201d) they need to do. Once the Quests are completed &amp; approved, the child will receive coins in the game that they can use to buy food to feed their pet (dont worry! there is no negative reinforcement here. I.e the pet just gets sleepy if it doesn\u2019t get fed, it won\u2019t die). This is the core game loop mechanic. There are longer game loops for the child to explore after they have mastered the core game loop such as dressing their pet, exploring new regions, unlocking new items, meeting friends, &amp; even minigames..<p>Interesting enough, people of all ages are using the app, not just kids. For example, neurodivergent adults have been finding value from using it, which is pretty cool to see. We were both surprised that adults would use Joon, but at the same time not surprised, since we ourselves only realized as adults that we hadn\u2019t developed many good habits as kids. In fact the earliest incarnation of the software was a prototype Kevin wrote while in college, to motivate himself to do things like get enough sleep.<p>In terms of pricing, we have just launched it as a subscription-based model with 3 plans to test. A monthly plan for $7.99, a quarterly plan for $16.99, and an annual plan for $49.99. Each plan can be used with a free trial or the user can just use a freemium version of the app for a certain amount of time without opting in to any plan.<p>Please let us know what you think and if applicable, share your experiences as a parent or gamer with us! We\u2019d love to dive in further in the comments"}

Powered by golang you can run load tests for tens of thousands of connections per second on very average hardware.\n2. Cross platform, run it on Windows or Mac or host it on your linux machines\n3. Lets you load test databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Mongodb out of the box.\n4.

I am 23 now and 3 years ago I have decided to learn programming on my own and I have been working as an iOS Developer for the past 2.5 years. Gradually I have come to realize that whenever I am getting stuck on something, it most likely stems from having no background in CS and having little to no information about how the computer, interpreters, compilers, programming languages etc. work. Neither I am able to solve algorithmic challenges - if I do try to solve them, it takes insane amount of time for me to get some understanding on how to approach the problem. Professionally speaking, while doing day-to-day iOS Dev agenda, no one even expects me to have some profound knowledge of CS concepts, as mostly iOS has been just a bunch of Apple Library calls, some networking and then layout, animations etc.<p>Having being immersed more and more into coding, I really would like to expand my knowledge and understand how the stuff in the background really works. My motivation here is to master this field to at least partly understand what I am doing and why I am doing things and also just out of pure curiosity, and also, frankly, being able to financially provide for my mom, that hasn&#x27;t been as lucky as me to end up in such a privileged position and also for my (possible) future family - spouse, child&#x2F;ren or other people in need. I might be wrong here, but I am convinced that having a solid theoretical and practical foundation would make me a better developer, having easier time time to learn other languages and technologies and would make me approach problems in a more efficient manner.<p>After reading through various forums and blogposts I have come across SICP as an important resource  for understanding how interpreters, recursions, and functional languages work among other concepts. I have been going through that book for the past 2 months and currently I am in the middle of the second chapter. During my studying process I have also been watching lectures Berkeley CS61A lectured by Brian Harvey to not rely solely on text. Although I have skipped just several really math heavy exercises and have done the rest of them, learning from this book literally made me cry today. Most of the exercises, even the seemingly easy ones, take me immense amount of time to solve, making me demotivated and full of doubt and leaving me exhausted, in need of taking a day of break to continue further. I generally don&#x27;t think my intelligence (in a sense of the speed of understanding complex concepts) is any good&#x2F;high enough to keep on learning CS&#x2F;programming. Little by little I am starting to doubt my abilities, whether I really should be doing programming, since I have such a hard time understanding things.<p>I do love programming, I do love learning new things and concepts, but I simply feel like I am not the right person to do it because my thinking is just way too slow&#x2F;limited.<p>Having said that, I am genuinely very grateful and very privileged to be in this position, tackling these kind of problems, I do understand majority of the population has not been as lucky as me.<p>Thanks for reading this far and for those who are in a similar situation, I just want to let you know that you are not alone and I really do wish you can get through whatever you are struggling with study&#x2F;work-wise."}
